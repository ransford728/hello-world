1.	Compose a program that writes the Hello, Worldmessage 10 times.
2.	Suppose that a and b are booleans. Show that the expression (not (a and b) and (a or b)) or ((a and b) or  not (a or b)) evaluates to True.
3.	Suppose that a and b are integers. Simplify the following expression: (not (a < b) and not (a > b))
4.	Suppose that x and y are two floats that represent the Cartesian coordinates of a point (x, y) in the plane. Give an expression that evaluates to the distance of the point from the origin.
5.	Compose a program that takes two integers a and bfrom the command line and writes a random integer between a and b.
6.	Compose a program that writes the sum of two random integers between 1 and 6 (such as you might get when rolling dice).
7.	Compose a program that takes a float t from the com‐mand line and writes the value of sin(2t) + sin(3t).
8.	Compose a program that takes three floats x 0 , v 0 , and from the command line, evaluates x 0 + v 0 t − G t 2 / 2, and writes the result. (Note: G is the constant 9.80665. This value is the displacement in meters after t seconds when an object is thrown straight up from initial position x 0 at velocity v 0 meters per second.)
